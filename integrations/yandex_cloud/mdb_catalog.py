"""The managed database engines, and how to reach each one.

Every engine has its own endpoint registry key and REST prefix even though they
all resolve to the same host. Several were renamed while keeping the old API
paths — MongoDB is now StoreDoc, Redis is Valkey, Greenplum is MPP Analytics —
so the display name and the path deliberately differ.

Data-plane ports are here because the most useful thing an investigation can do
with a managed database is stop looking at the control plane and go query it.
